# Real Time Coal Mine Monitoring System

Underground mining operations proves to be a risky venture as far as the safety and health of workers are concerned. These risks are due to different techniques used for extracting different minerals. The deeper the mine, the greater is the risk. These safety issues are of grave concern especially in case of coal industries. Thus, safety of workers should always be of major consideration in any form of mining, whether it is coal or any other minerals.

Underground coal mining involves a higher risk due to the problems of ventilation and potential for collapse. Coal has always been the primary resource of energy in India, which has significantly contributed to the rapid industrial development of the country. But the production brings with it the other byproducts, which proves to be a potential threat to the environment and the people associated with it. So the present work is a sincere attempt in analyzing and designing a real time monitoring system of detection for coal mine safety.
